Much of the darakhul's attitude derives from their inherent sense of superiority, since very few darakhul have encountered winterghasts. If not for the winterghasts' remote location, the darakhul would have attempted to wipe them out long ago. Some darakhul necromancers have researched the creation of darakhul-winterghast hybrids, eradicating the winterghasts' susceptibility to fire and their hunger for frostbitten flesh.
